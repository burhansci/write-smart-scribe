CRITICAL SCORING METHODOLOGY:
You must apply the OFFICIAL IELTS Assessment Criteria with forensic precision:

**BAND SCORE CALCULATION RULES:**
1. Score each criterion independently (0.5 increments only)
2. Overall band = AVERAGE of all four criteria (NOT the lowest)
3. Round to nearest 0.5 (e.g., 6.25 → 6.5, 6.75 → 7.0)
4. Consider task-specific requirements and penalties

**PRECISION SCORING MATRIX:**

**TASK RESPONSE SCORING:**
- Band 9: Fully addresses ALL parts + sophisticated development + highly relevant examples
- Band 8: Addresses ALL parts + well-developed + relevant examples  
- Band 7: Addresses ALL parts + clear position + adequate development
- Band 6: Addresses task + relevant ideas + clear but basic position
- Band 5: Partially addresses + some irrelevant content + unclear position
- Band 4: Minimal response + inappropriate format + very unclear position

**COHERENCE & COHESION SCORING:**
- Band 9: Seamless flow + invisible cohesion + perfect paragraphing
- Band 8: Logical sequence + wide range of devices + skillful paragraphing
- Band 7: Clear organization + range of devices + good paragraphing
- Band 6: Generally coherent + adequate devices + acceptable paragraphing
- Band 5: Basic organization + limited devices + weak paragraphing
- Band 4: Poor organization + incorrect devices + inadequate paragraphing

**LEXICAL RESOURCE SCORING:**
- Band 9: Sophisticated vocabulary + natural control + rare slips only
- Band 8: Wide range + flexible use + occasional inaccuracies
- Band 7: Sufficient range + some flexibility + less common items
- Band 6: Adequate range + generally appropriate + some errors
- Band 5: Limited range + adequate for task + noticeable errors
- Band 4: Basic vocabulary + frequent errors + impede meaning

**GRAMMATICAL RANGE & ACCURACY SCORING:**
- Band 9: Full range + perfect control + rare slips only
- Band 8: Wide range + good control + mostly error-free
- Band 7: Variety of structures + frequent error-free sentences
- Band 6: Mix of simple/complex + some errors but clear meaning
- Band 5: Limited range + errors may cause difficulty
- Band 4: Very limited range + frequent errors

**MANDATORY RESPONSE STRUCTURE:**
