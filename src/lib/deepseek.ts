Your response must follow this EXACT format with these section headers:

**Score**
Provide the estimated IELTS band score (format: "7.0" or "6.5")

**Explanation** 
Write a concise analysis (100-120 words) covering:
- Task Response: Direct answer to question, clear position, relevant examples
- Coherence & Cohesion: Paragraph structure, logical flow, linking words
- Lexical Resource: Vocabulary variety, accuracy, collocations
- Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Sentence variety, error frequency, complexity

Focus on 2-3 key strengths and 2-3 priority areas for improvement.

**Line-by-Line Analysis**
Analyze each sentence individually with DETAILED, SPECIFIC feedback. For each sentence, identify:
- EXACT words/phrases that need improvement (not just categories)
- SPECIFIC error types with clear explanations
- PRECISE suggestions with reasons why they're better
- Academic writing improvements

Format each line as:
Line [number]: "[complete original sentence]"
Specific Issues:
• [Error Type]: "[exact problematic phrase]" → Issue: [detailed explanation of why it's wrong]
• [Error Type]: "[exact problematic phrase]" → Issue: [detailed explanation of why it's wrong]
Specific Suggestions:
• Replace "[exact original phrase]" with "[suggested improvement]" → Reason: [why this is better for IELTS]
• Change "[exact original phrase]" to "[suggested improvement]" → Reason: [academic writing improvement]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low based on band score impact]

Example format:
Line 1: "The students is studying very hard for they exam."
Specific Issues:
• Grammar: "students is" → Issue: Subject-verb disagreement (plural subject needs plural verb)
• Spelling: "they exam" → Issue: Incorrect pronoun usage (should be possessive "their")
• Word Choice: "very hard" → Issue: Too informal for academic writing
Specific Suggestions:
• Replace "students is" with "students are" → Reason: Correct subject-verb agreement improves grammatical accuracy
• Change "they exam" to "their examination" → Reason: Correct possessive form and more formal vocabulary
• Replace "very hard" with "diligently" → Reason: More sophisticated vocabulary for higher band score
Priority: High

Be extremely specific - identify exact words, phrases, and provide detailed explanations for each issue.

**Marked Errors**
Identify 5-8 critical errors that impact the band score. Use this exact format:
[error_text]{ErrorType: Specific correction}

Examples:
[don't have]{Subject-Verb Agreement: Use "doesn't have"}
[very good]{Word Choice: Use "excellent" for academic writing}
[alot]{Spelling: Should be "a lot"}
[In conclusion of]{Grammar: Use "In conclusion," or "To conclude,"}

Focus on errors that will make the biggest impact on band score improvement.

**Improved with Suggestions**
Show 3-5 specific improvements using these markers:
- [+word/phrase+] for additions that improve clarity/flow
- [~word~] for words to remove/replace  
- [+word+]{explanation} for vocabulary/grammar upgrades

Example: "The economy [+has been significantly+] affected. [~Very~] [+Numerous+] people [+have become+] unemployed [+as a direct consequence+]."

Keep suggestions practical and immediately applicable. Focus on improvements that raise the band score.

**Band 9 Version**
YOU MUST PROVIDE A COMPLETE BAND 9 REWRITE - THIS IS MANDATORY AND REQUIRED.

This section is CRITICAL and MUST be included in every response. Provide a complete Band 9 rewrite of the entire original text that demonstrates:

VOCABULARY REQUIREMENTS:
- Sophisticated vocabulary with precise collocations
- Advanced academic terminology where appropriate
- Varied synonyms avoiding repetition
- Natural, native-like word choices

GRAMMAR REQUIREMENTS:
- Complex grammatical structures with varied sentence types
- Perfect grammar with zero errors
- Advanced sentence patterns (conditional, subjunctive, etc.)
- Sophisticated punctuation usage

COHESION REQUIREMENTS:
- Advanced cohesive devices and linking expressions
- Seamless paragraph transitions
- Logical flow with clear argument progression
- Sophisticated discourse markers

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Precise academic language and formal register
- Natural flow with sophisticated reasoning
- Nuanced argumentation with depth
- Appropriate word count matching the task

IMPORTANT: Write the complete Band 9 version as flowing, natural text without any markers or annotations. This should serve as the target standard the student should aspire to reach. The Band 9 version MUST be substantial and complete - never write "not available" or short responses.

CRITICAL: The Band 9 Version section is MANDATORY. Every response MUST include a full, comprehensive Band 9 rewrite. This is not optional.

IMPORTANT: Be specific, concise, and actionable. Avoid generic advice. Each suggestion should clearly explain why it's better.`;
