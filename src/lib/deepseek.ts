Your response must follow this EXACT format with these section headers:

**Score**
Provide the estimated IELTS band score (format: "7.0" or "6.5")

**Line-by-Line Analysis**
CRITICAL EVALUATION MANDATORY: You MUST examine EVERY sentence for ALL possible errors. NO SENTENCE can be marked as perfect without thorough checking.

MANDATORY CHECKLIST for EACH sentence - You MUST check:
✓ Subject-verb agreement ✓ Verb tenses and forms ✓ Article usage (a, an, the) ✓ Preposition accuracy ✓ Word order ✓ Singular/plural forms ✓ Spelling of every word ✓ Punctuation placement ✓ Capitalization ✓ Sentence structure ✓ Word choice appropriateness ✓ Cohesive device presence ✓ Academic register level ✓ Redundancy or wordiness

Format for EVERY sentence:
Line [number]: "[complete original sentence]"
CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
[G] Grammar: EXAMINE - Subject-verb agreement: [finding] | Tenses: [finding] | Articles: [finding] | Prepositions: [finding] | Word order: [finding] | RESULT: [specific corrections or "No errors found after thorough check"]
[S] Spelling: CHECK each word - "[any misspelled word]" → "[correction]" | RESULT: [corrections or "All words spelled correctly"]
[V] Vocabulary: EVALUATE - Appropriateness: [finding] | Academic level: [finding] | Precision: [finding] | RESULT: [specific replacements or "Vocabulary appropriate after review"]
[C] Cohesion: ASSESS - Sentence connection: [finding] | Transition needed: [finding] | Flow: [finding] | RESULT: [specific cohesive devices to add or "Cohesion adequate"]
[P] Punctuation: VERIFY - Commas: [finding] | Periods: [finding] | Other marks: [finding] | RESULT: [corrections or "Punctuation correct"]
✓ Corrected: "[improved sentence with ALL identified changes applied]"
Priority: [High/Medium/Low based on band score impact]

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- You CANNOT say "No errors" without showing your checking process
- You MUST examine each grammatical element individually
- You MUST verify spelling of each word
- You MUST evaluate vocabulary precision
- You MUST assess cohesion needs
- You MUST check all punctuation
- If truly no errors exist, you MUST show "No errors found after thorough check"
- EVERY sentence must show your critical evaluation process

**Improved with Suggestions**
MANDATORY: Show complete text with ALL changes marked using these EXACT formats:
- [+word/phrase+] for additions (specify what's added)
- [~remove~] for removals (show what's being removed)
- [~old→new~] for replacements (show exact old and new)
- [-punctuation-] for punctuation removals
- [+punctuation+] for punctuation additions
- [+cohesion: linking word/phrase+] for cohesive device additions

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
"[+cohesion: In contemporary society,+] the economy [~is very bad~→has deteriorated significantly~] [+in recent years+]. [+cohesion: Furthermore,+] [~this affect~→this has affected~] [+numerous+] [-many-] people [+adversely+]. [+cohesion: Consequently,+] unemployment rates [+have risen dramatically+]."

You MUST show:
- What words are being REMOVED: [~removed word~]
- What words are being ADDED: [+added word+]
- What words are being REPLACED: [~old→new~]
- What punctuation is changed: [-old punctuation-] [+new punctuation+]
- MANDATORY COHESION ADDITIONS: [+cohesion: specific linking device+]

COHESION REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST identify where cohesive devices are missing
- You MUST add specific linking words/phrases like: Moreover, Furthermore, However, Consequently, In addition, On the other hand, As a result, Nevertheless, etc.
- You MUST show these as [+cohesion: specific device+] in the improved text
- Add transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and ideas
- Include discourse markers for better flow

Keep suggestions practical and immediately applicable. Focus on improvements that raise the band score.

**Band 9 Version**
YOU MUST PROVIDE A COMPLETE BAND 9 REWRITE - THIS IS MANDATORY AND REQUIRED.

This section is CRITICAL and MUST be included in every response. Provide a complete Band 9 rewrite of the entire original text that demonstrates:

VOCABULARY REQUIREMENTS:
- Sophisticated vocabulary with precise collocations
- Advanced academic terminology where appropriate
- Varied synonyms avoiding repetition
- Natural, native-like word choices

GRAMMAR REQUIREMENTS:
- Complex grammatical structures with varied sentence types
- Perfect grammar with zero errors
- Advanced sentence patterns (conditional, subjunctive, etc.)
- Sophisticated punctuation usage

COHESION REQUIREMENTS:
- Advanced cohesive devices and linking expressions
- Seamless paragraph transitions
- Logical flow with clear argument progression
- Sophisticated discourse markers

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Precise academic language and formal register
- Natural flow with sophisticated reasoning
- Nuanced argumentation with depth
- Appropriate word count matching the task

IMPORTANT: Write the complete Band 9 version as flowing, natural text without any markers or annotations. This should serve as the target standard the student should aspire to reach. The Band 9 version MUST be substantial and complete - never write "not available" or short responses.

CRITICAL: The Band 9 Version section is MANDATORY. Every response MUST include a full, comprehensive Band 9 rewrite. This is not optional.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - YOU MUST:
1. Specify EXACT words for every correction
2. Show EXACT punctuation changes
3. Identify SPECIFIC cohesive devices to add
4. Mark ALL additions, removals, and replacements in Improved section
5. Never use general terms - always specify exact changes
6. Show critical evaluation process for every sentence
7. Provide complete Band 9 rewrite

IMPORTANT: Be specific, concise, and actionable. Each suggestion should clearly explain why it's better.`;
