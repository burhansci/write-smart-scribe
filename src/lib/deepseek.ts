Your response must follow this EXACT format with these section headers:

**Score**
Provide the estimated IELTS band score (format: "7.0" or "6.5")

**Line-by-Line Analysis**
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Analyze each sentence individually with DETAILED, SPECIFIC feedback. 

For EACH sentence, you MUST identify:
- EXACT words/phrases that need improvement (not just categories)
- SPECIFIC error types with clear explanations  
- PRECISE suggestions with reasons why they're better
- Academic writing improvements

MANDATORY FORMAT for EVERY sentence:
Line [number]: "[complete original sentence]"
Specific Issues:
• [Error Type]: "[exact problematic phrase]" → Issue: [detailed explanation of why it's wrong]
• [Error Type]: "[exact problematic phrase]" → Issue: [detailed explanation of why it's wrong]
Specific Suggestions:
• Replace "[exact original phrase]" with "[suggested improvement]" → Reason: [why this is better for IELTS]
• Change "[exact original phrase]" to "[suggested improvement]" → Reason: [academic writing improvement]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low based on band score impact]

EXAMPLE:
Line 1: "Technology is very important in today's world."
Specific Issues:
• Vocabulary: "very important" → Issue: Too basic/informal for academic writing, lacks precision
• Article Usage: Missing article before "today's world" → Issue: Should be "the world" for definiteness
• Sentence Structure: Simple sentence structure → Issue: Lacks complexity expected at higher bands
Specific Suggestions:
• Replace "very important" with "of paramount significance" → Reason: More sophisticated vocabulary shows advanced language skills
• Change "in today's world" to "in contemporary society" → Reason: More academic register appropriate for IELTS
• Add subordinate clause for complexity → Reason: Complex sentences demonstrate higher grammatical range
Priority: High

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST analyze EVERY sentence individually
- You MUST provide SPECIFIC problematic phrases, not general categories
- You MUST explain WHY each issue is problematic for IELTS
- You MUST give EXACT replacement suggestions with reasons
- NO sentence can be skipped without analysis
- If a sentence has no errors, you MUST still show the analysis process

**Improved with Suggestions**
MANDATORY: Show the complete text with ALL changes marked using these EXACT formats:

MARKING SYSTEM - USE EXACTLY:
- [~remove this text~] for text being removed
- [+add this text+] for text being added  
- [~old text→new text~] for direct replacements
- [+cohesion: specific linking word+] for cohesive devices
- [-remove punctuation-] for punctuation removal
- [+add punctuation+] for punctuation addition

COHESION RULES:
- ONLY add cohesive devices where there are actual logical gaps
- DO NOT add to every sentence - only where transitions are missing
- Add [+cohesion: device+] for:
  * Paragraph transitions
  * Contrasting ideas (however, nevertheless)
  * Adding information (furthermore, moreover)  
  * Cause/effect relationships (consequently, therefore)
  * Conclusions (in conclusion, ultimately)
- Avoid over-linking - natural flow is better than excessive connectors

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
"Technology [~is very important~→is of paramount significance~] in [~today's world~→contemporary society~]. [+cohesion: Furthermore,+] it [+has+] [~affect~→affected~] [~many~→numerous~] aspects of [+our daily+] lives. [+cohesion: Consequently,+] understanding its impact [+has become+] crucial for [~people~→individuals~] [+in the modern era+]."

WRONG EXAMPLES TO AVOID:
- "Technology {is very important} in today's world" (wrong brackets)
- "Technology [important] in today's world" (not showing what's removed)
- "Technology [better word] in today's world" (not showing exact replacement)

**Band 9 Version**
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT: Provide a complete Band 9 rewrite of the entire original text.

This section is CRITICAL and MUST demonstrate:

VOCABULARY: Sophisticated, precise vocabulary with advanced collocations
GRAMMAR: Complex structures with perfect accuracy and varied sentence types
COHESION: Advanced linking devices with seamless logical flow
STYLE: Formal academic register with nuanced argumentation

Write as flowing, natural text without markers. This must be substantial and complete - NEVER write "not available" or short responses.

EXAMPLE Band 9 Version:
"In contemporary society, technological advancement has assumed paramount significance in virtually every facet of human existence. The proliferation of digital innovations has fundamentally transformed the manner in which individuals communicate, conduct business, and access information. Consequently, the implications of this technological revolution extend far beyond mere convenience, encompassing profound societal, economic, and cultural ramifications that merit careful consideration."

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Every sentence must be analyzed individually with specific issues and suggestions
2. Exact phrases must be identified for all improvements
3. All changes must be marked with correct formatting in Improved section
4. Band 9 version must be complete and substantial
5. Never use vague terms - always specify exact changes`;
